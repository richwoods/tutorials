We use a number of tools in our weekly workflow to create slides for both campuses, including some we built ourselves.

## Dropbox
Used for syncing files across computers. [Download](http://dropbox.com) for PC or Mac. Ask your volunteer team leader if you need to add the shared folders to a new account.

## ProPresenter
Used for playing slides and media, for now. Surely there's something more stable and better-built out there. [Download](http://www.renewedvision.com/propresenter.php) for PC or Mac.
Ask your volunteer team leader for licensing information. You shouldn't need it on your home machine if you can remotely connect to the Mac at church.

## TeamViewer
Used for connecting to our presentation machines remotely. [Download](http://teamviewer.com) for PC or Mac.
Ask your volunteer team leader for the 9-digit pin and password.

## WorshipKit Pager
This parent pager app runs on our Macs, and displays numbers, sent from the childrens' ministry for parents. [Read more and download](http://worshipkit.com)

## Flickr Slides
This app pulls from our Flickr account, where we store our announcement slides. It then wraps the selected announcements into a set of ProPresenter slides for you. It can optionally make them automatically loop.

## Sermon Countdown
This app is a quick countdown for your stage display. Choose the correct screen, type in the time you'd like to count down from and click "Start". It can display on top of ProPresenter and other apps.
